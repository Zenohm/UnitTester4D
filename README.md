UnitTester for 4D v11 and v12
=============================

As a parting gift to the 4D community, I have decided to make UnitTester free and open source.

UnitTester is copyleft licensed under [The MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

I have not yet removed the UnitTester license enforcement code in UnitTester, so it will still require a valid license to be run in non-demo mode. Until that code has been removed, you may use this license key which allows for full team development (4D client server) with up to 6 concurrent client developers.

Happy Unit Testing!

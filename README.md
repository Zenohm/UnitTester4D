UnitTester for 4D v11 and v12
=============================

As a parting gift to the 4D community, I have decided to make UnitTester free and open source.

UnitTester is copyleft licensed under [The MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).

Some notes...
* Source is for v11, but can be migrated to v12 by opening it with 4D v12
* Reference documentation is included in UnitTester.4dbase/Resources/UnitTester_Reference.pdf
* I have not removed the UnitTester license enforcement code in UnitTester, so it will still require a valid license to be run in non-demo mode. Until that code has been removed, you may use the following license key which allows for full team development (4D client server) with up to 6 concurrent client developers:

    F2R2-NXIP-OA03-JL10

* Please do not contact me for support as I do not have time to provide it

Happy Unit Testing!
